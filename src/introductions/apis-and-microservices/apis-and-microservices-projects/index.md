## Introduction to the APIs and Microservices Projects

It's now time to test out the skills learned through out these backend exercises.
In this section you will create the following Node/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose programs:
* Timestamp Microservice
* Request Header Parser Microservice
* URL Shortener Microservice
* Exercise Tracker
* File Metadata Microservice

Have fun and remember to use the Read-Search-Ask method if you get stuck.

Good Luck!
